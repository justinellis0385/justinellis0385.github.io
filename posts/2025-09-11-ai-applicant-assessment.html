					<h2>The Problem: Drowning in Resumes</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>For any busy recruiter, the application inbox is a constant battle. Sifting through hundreds of resumes for a single job is not only time-consuming but also mentally exhausting. The traditional process of manually scanning resumes for keywords and trying to match experience to a job description is inefficient and prone to error. You might miss a great candidate, or you might spend hours reviewing unqualified applicants, all while the best talent is being snatched up by the competition. The sheer volume of applications creates a bottleneck that slows down the entire hiring process.</p>

					<h2>The Solution: Intelligent Applicant Filtering</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>To solve this, I’ve built a custom automation system using Python and Gemini. The core idea is to create an intelligent filter that assesses every applicant the moment they apply. This allows me to focus my time on the most promising candidates, not on manual screening.</p>
					<p>Here’s the high-level process:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Automatic Intake:</strong> A Python script constantly monitors a dedicated Gmail inbox for new applications.</li>
						<li><strong>Smart Data Retrieval:</strong> Upon receiving an email, the script extracts the applicant’s resume and identifies the unique Job ID from the email subject line. It then retrieves the job's specific criteria and a pre-built AI assessment template from a centralized database.</li>
						<li><strong>Real-Time Assessment:</strong> The resume and the job criteria are sent to Gemini, powered by a custom set of instructions. The model analyzes the candidate's resume and returns a structured, data-driven assessment in real time, highlighting key skills, relevant experience, and overall fit.</li>
						<li><strong>Targeted Notifications:</strong> The script receives the assessment and, based on the results, automatically sends me a notification with a full report for every candidate who is deemed a strong or good fit.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>The Impact: From Bottleneck to Pipeline</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>This project has fundamentally changed my recruiting workflow.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Time Saved:</strong> I've eliminated the hours I used to spend on initial resume screening. The system performs this task instantly and with a level of consistency that is impossible to replicate manually.</li>
						<li><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> Every candidate is now assessed against a consistent, objective set of criteria, reducing the risk of bias and ensuring I don't overlook a qualified applicant.</li>
						<li><strong>Speed to Market:</strong> I can contact top-tier candidates within minutes of them applying, giving me a significant competitive advantage.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This automation is not about replacing the recruiter; it’s about empowering them to be more effective. By handling the administrative burden of initial screening, this system allows me to focus on what truly matters: engaging with people and building relationships. It proves that with the right tools, technology can be a powerful partner in the art of recruiting.</p>
