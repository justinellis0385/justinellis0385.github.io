					<h2>The Problem: Drowning in Resumes</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>For any busy recruiter, the application inbox is a constant battle. Sifting through hundreds of resumes for a single job is not only time-consuming but also mentally exhausting. The traditional process of manually scanning resumes for keywords and trying to match experience to a job description is inefficient and prone to error. You might miss a great candidate, or you might spend hours reviewing unqualified applicants, all while the best talent is being snatched up by the competition. The sheer volume of applications creates a bottleneck that slows down the entire hiring process.</p>

					<h2>The Solution: Intelligent Applicant Filtering</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>To solve this, I’ve built a custom automation system using a combination of scripting and a powerful large language model. The core idea is to create an intelligent filter that assesses every applicant the moment they apply. This allows me to focus my time on the most promising candidates, not on manual screening.</p>
					<p>Here’s the high-level process:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Automatic Intake:</strong> A script constantly monitors a dedicated inbox for new applications.</li>
						<li><strong>Smart Data Retrieval:</strong> Upon receiving an email, the script extracts the applicant’s resume and identifies the unique Job ID. It then retrieves the job's specific criteria and a pre-built AI assessment template from a centralized database.</li>
						<li><strong>Real-Time Assessment:</strong> The resume and the job criteria are sent to a powerful AI model, powered by a custom set of instructions. The model analyzes the candidate's resume and returns a structured, data-driven assessment in real time, highlighting key skills, relevant experience, and overall fit.</li>
						<li><strong>Targeted Notifications:</strong> The script receives the assessment and, based on the results, automatically sends me a notification with a full report for every candidate who is deemed a strong or good fit.</li>
					</ol>

					<h2>The Impact: From Bottleneck to Pipeline</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>This project has fundamentally changed my recruiting workflow.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Time Saved:</strong> I've eliminated the hours I used to spend on initial resume screening. The system performs this task instantly and with a level of consistency that is impossible to replicate manually.</li>
						<li><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> Every candidate is now assessed against a consistent, objective set of criteria, reducing the risk of bias and ensuring I don't overlook a qualified applicant.</li>
						<li><strong>Speed to Market:</strong> I can contact top-tier candidates within minutes of them applying, giving me a significant competitive advantage.</li>

						<h2>The System in Action: Two Candidate Examples</h3>
					</header>
					<p>To demonstrate the power of this automation, here are two anonymized examples of the system's output—one for a strong fit and one for a poor fit for a highly technical data engineering role.</p>

					<div class="card">
						<header>
							<h4>Candidate Assessment: Strong Fit</h4>
							<p><strong>Candidate A</strong></p>
						</header>
						<p><strong>IDMC (Informatica Data Management Cloud)</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Strong Fit:</strong> Candidate A's resume explicitly mentions recent and extensive experience with Informatica Cloud, which is another name for IDMC.</li>
							<li><strong>Source:</strong> Under "Professional Summary," the resume states, "Proven expertise in designing, developing, and optimizing ETL processes using Informatica PowerCenter and Informatica Cloud."</li>
							<li><strong>Source:</strong> Under "Professional Experience," roles at a healthcare company (2018-Current) list the use of "Informatica PowerCenter and Informatica Cloud" for developing and maintaining ETL processes.</li>
							<li><strong>Source:</strong> The resume also notes assisting in "migrating legacy ETL processes to Informatica Cloud for improved scalability," which is a verifiable project example. This experience is within the last 18 months.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Solutions Design & Domain Expertise</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Good Fit:</strong> Candidate A has a strong background in solutions design, with experience in a regulated industry.</li>
							<li><strong>Source:</strong> Under "Professional Summary," the resume states "Proven expertise in designing, developing, and optimizing ETL processes."</li>
							<li><strong>Domain Expertise:</strong> Candidate A has a strong background in health insurance at a major healthcare provider. While not property and casualty insurance, it is a regulated industry that requires a similar level of data governance and compliance.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Work Authorization</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>No Information:</strong> The resume does not provide any information regarding work authorization. This will need to be verified during the introductory call.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Location & Commute</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Strong Fit:</strong> Candidate A's general location is within a commutable distance to the job site, making them a strong fit for the on-site requirement.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Potential Red Flags/Concerns</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Work Authorization:</strong> The candidate's work authorization status is not listed on the resume. This needs to be clarified to ensure no sponsorship is required.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Technical Interview Questions</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>"Your resume lists both Informatica PowerCenter and Informatica Cloud. Can you tell us about a specific project where you used IDMC, and what were the key differences you found between working with the on-premise and cloud versions?"</li>
							<li>"Your background is in health insurance. Can you describe how your experience with data governance and compliance in that field would translate to the unique challenges of the property and casualty insurance industry?"</li>
							<li>"Can you confirm your work authorization status and if you require any form of sponsorship?"</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Overall Assessment</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Summary:</strong> Candidate A is a strong candidate with explicit and recent experience with Informatica Cloud (IDMC) and a relevant background in a regulated industry. Their location is ideal for the on-site requirement. The only remaining item to clarify is their work authorization.</li>
							<li><strong>Overall Fit:</strong> Strong Fit</li>
							<li><strong>Introduction Call Recommendation:</strong> Schedule an introduction call.</li>
							<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> Candidate A's resume demonstrates a high level of proficiency and recent, explicit experience with IDMC (Informatica Cloud), which is the most critical skill for this role. Additionally, their location is ideal, and their background in a regulated industry is a significant plus. An introductory call is recommended to clarify work authorization.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="card">
						<header>
							<h4>Candidate Assessment: Not a Good Fit</h4>
							<p><strong>Candidate B</strong></p>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Overall Fit:</strong> Not a Good Fit</li>
							<li><strong>Summary:</strong> The candidate has extensive experience in data engineering and is located within a reasonable commute for the on-site role. They also have a strong background in the insurance and financial industries, with a direct work history at a major insurance company. However, their resume does not mention any experience with Informatica or IDMC, which is a primary requirement for this role. Therefore, an introductory call is not suggested.</li>
						</ul>

					<p>This automation is not about replacing the recruiter; it’s about empowering them to be more effective. By handling the administrative burden of initial screening, this system allows me to focus on what truly matters: engaging with people and building relationships. It proves that with the right tools, technology can be a powerful partner in the art of recruiting.</p>
