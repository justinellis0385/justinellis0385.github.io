					<h2>Automating My Interview Schedule: A Recruiter's Journey with Calendly and JotForm</h2>

					<p>As a technical recruiter, my day is a constant race against the clock. One of the biggest time sinks is a seemingly simple task: scheduling an introductory call. It sounds easy, but it’s a manual process that creates a lot of wasted time.</p>

					<h3>The Problem: The Endless Email Exchange</h3>
					<p>The traditional method involves a slow, back-and-forth email chain. I would manually send a candidate a list of available times, which could be outdated in minutes as I’m reaching out to dozens of people daily. This creates a lot of wasted time as I’m constantly updating people on my new availability—only for them to be unavailable during those times.</p>
					<p>Another major hurdle? Getting a candidate's resume. Even if they applied via LinkedIn or a job board like Dice, I often needed to ask them to resend their resume to have it on file. This added another layer of manual follow-up to an already inefficient process.</p>

					<h3>The Solution: A Simple, Two-Tool Automation</h3>
					<p>To solve this, I leveraged two free tools: Calendly and JotForm. My goal was to create a single link that a candidate could use to both book an interview time with me *and* upload their resume in one seamless flow.</p>
					<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>I send a candidate a link to a simple JotForm. As you can see below, the form is clean and asks for just the basics: name, email, phone number, and a place to upload their resume.</li>
						<li><img src="../images/image_3c95bc.png" alt="Screenshot of the JotForm" /></li>
						<li>Once a candidate submits the form, I get an immediate email notification with their resume attached. This completely bypasses the need for manual follow-up and ensures I have their resume before our call.</li>
						<li>The confirmation page of the JotForm is redirected to my Calendly booking page. The Calendly page is set up as a "Job Introduction Call."</li>
						<li><img src="../images/image_3c9617.png" alt="Screenshot of the Calendly booking page" /></li>
						<li>On the Calendly page, the candidate can instantly see my real-time availability and book a 30-minute phone call. The magic is that my availability is always up-to-date, so there's no more manual communication or double-booking.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>The Impact: Wasted Time to Valuable Time</h3>
					<p>This simple automation has transformed my daily workflow.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>**Time Saved:** I've eliminated the hours I used to spend on scheduling. All I do now is send one message with a single link, and the rest is automated.</li>
						<li>**A Better Candidate Experience:** The process is faster and more professional for the candidate. It shows that I'm efficient and respect their time.</li>
						<li>**All-in-One Information:** I now have both the scheduled appointment and the candidate's resume in my inbox, all from a single action.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This project is just the beginning of my journey to use technology to shape the future of recruiting. It proves that you don't need complex, expensive software to make a meaningful difference in your day-to-day work. My next project will be using scripting and generative AI to automatically summarize and screen resumes. Stay tuned!</p>
