  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    From the Marine Corps to technical recruiting, my journey has been anything but ordinary. My experience leading teams in demanding environments now drives my passion for building efficient, human-centered technology solutions. I thrive on automating processes that empower peopleâ€”and I love sharing what I learn along the way, especially as I teach my kids through the educational app I built for them.<br><br>
    Ask me about AI in recruiting, veteran transitions, or how I squeeze every bit of productivity from my day!
